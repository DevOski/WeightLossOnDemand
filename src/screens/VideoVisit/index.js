            How our trainers follow the procedure to help clients There is no
            need to travel to an unknown location, waste time getting there, or
            risk meeting a friend or family member when you can meet with one of
            our experienced trainers in the comfort of your own home. A session
            with one of our qualified trainers is equivalent to meeting in but
            may take place whenever and wherever it is most convenient for you.
            During this survey, you will be asked to share details about your
            lifestyle and health habits. Having this background will enable our
            trainers to provide you with more tailored support.

            Our medical doctors are trained to provide care through video visits
            by employing many of the same practices and techniques that are used
            in a traditional doctorâ€™s office. If you would like to have a visit.
            Parents, please be sure to select your child during intake before
            confirming the visit, and ensure your child is present during the
            visit.
